# Capstone Design ME Scheduling Software

This project uses the the sample Auth0 application [Auth0 React SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-react) to create a scheduling platform the the University of Idaho Mechanical Engineering Department. 

## Project setup

Software Needed 
- ["node.js"](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- ["git"](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- The website is published on Heroku at cs.metest.herokuapp.com

Use `npm` to install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

You can ensure needed dependencies are installed by using:
```bash
node --version
```
```bash
npm --version
```
```bash
git --version
```


To run the program on your local host use 'start' from within the directory.

```bash
npm start
```

## Configuration

### Create an API

For the ["call an API"](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/02-calling-an-api) page to work, you will need to [create an API](https://auth0.com/docs/apis) using the [management dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/apis). This will give you an API identifier that you can use in the `audience` configuration field below.

If you do not wish to use an API or observe the API call working, you should not specify the `audience` value in the next step. Otherwise, you will receive a "Service not found" error when trying to authenticate.

### Configure credentials

The project needs to be configured with your Auth0 domain and client ID in order for the authentication flow to work.

To do this, first copy `src/auth_config.json.example` into a new file in the same folder called `src/auth_config.json`, and replace the values with your own Auth0 application credentials, and optionally the base URLs of your application and API:

```json
{
  "domain": "{YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN}",
  "clientId": "{YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID}",
  "audience": "{YOUR AUTH0 API_IDENTIFIER}",
  "appOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR APPLICATION (default: http://localhost:3000)}",
  "apiOrigin": "{OPTIONAL: THE BASE URL OF YOUR API (default: http://localhost:3001)}"
}
```

**Note**: Do not specify a value for `audience` here if you do not wish to use the API part of the sample.

## Run the sample

### Compile and hot-reload for development

This compiles and serves the React app and starts the backend API server on port 3001.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deployment

### Compiles and minifies for production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Docker build

To build and run the Docker image, run `exec.sh`, or `exec.ps1` on Windows.

### Run your tests

```bash
npm run test
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

- Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
- Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
- Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
- Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
- Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
- Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
